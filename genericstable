# Function:
#    Cause certain addresses originating locally (unqualified), or
#    from a domain in $=G to be rewritten based upon the map below.
#    This mapping may change both the user and domain name.
#
# Usage:
#    FEATURE(genericstable[, type [-o] /etc/mail/genericstable])dnl
#    makemap hash genericstable < genericstable
#
# Format:
#   localuser          realuser@realdomain   <<- implied $j or masq domain
#   user@host          realuser@realhost     <<- tried first
#   user[@host]	       realuser[@realhost]
#
# Examples:
#
# Notes:
#   * Masquerading is *required* for genericstable support!
#   * Then genericstable should only be enabled if needed as it 
#     causes every sender to be looked up in the database
#   * Members of $=w are *not* automatically placed in $=G
#   * For local mail, FEATURE(always_add_domain) is necessary
#
